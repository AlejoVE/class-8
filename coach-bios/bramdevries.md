# Bram Devries

Born and raised in Belgium, on the outskirts of Leuven. 

I currently work as a software engineer at [madewithlove](https://madewithlove.com/) where I help build web-based products using an API-first approach.

My prefered programming languages are PHP (either with or without a framework) and Javascript (Preferably with React JS). 
I value the usage of [design patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) where appropriate and try to apply techniques such as [Domain Drivn Design](https://dddcommunity.org/learning-ddd/what_is_ddd/) in my day-to-day work.
