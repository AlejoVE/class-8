# Gr√©gory Hermans

I was born in Brussels and lived here all my life. I'm married with two children.

I have been in IT for more than 20 years.
I'm IT Manager for [Brusafe](http://brusafe.brussels/) which is a brand new civil security school in Brussels (civil security meaning police, firemen, paramedics, etc...).

So I'm more into management nowadays and less into development, but I used to be a Microsoft.Net lead developer and solutions architect.
I was specialized in C# and Microsoft .Net framework, backend development, integration (web services and service bus), design patterns, custom framework development, DevOps (when it was still called ALM : application lifecycle management), Scrum methodology, and I also had a reasonable experience as front-end development for both Windows and the web (ASP.Net). I also know Microsoft Azure pretty well. 

I have actually also a good experience of other IT domains outside of development. In networking and security, for example (firewalling, VPN, PKI) so I was often the guy in the development team who had to investigate obscure http/tls misconfiguration problems.

I don't have extensive experience in JavaScript yet, but I'm humbly transitioning my skills from C#/.net to the JavaScript stack so that I can help you guys. Be assured : I still consider myself an expert in algorithmics, object-oriented programming and software engineering methodologies.
